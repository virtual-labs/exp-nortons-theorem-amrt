      "question": "Five volts is applied to two 2 ohm resistors in series. The resulting current is?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Not enough information is given.",
        "b": "2.5 A",
        "c": "1.25 A",
        "d": "5 A"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. We have enough information: total resistance = 4Ω.",
        "b": "Too high; check Ohm’s law.",
        "c": "Correct. Total resistance = 4Ω; I = V/R = 5/4 = 1.25 A.",
        "d": "Too high; would require lower resistance."

      "question": "Five volts is applied to two 2 ohm resistors connected in parallel. The resulting current is?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "5 A",

        "d": "1.25 A"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Too high; implies a much lower total resistance.",
        "b": "Too low; calculate total parallel resistance.",
        "c": "Correct. Parallel resistance = 1Ω; I = 5V / 1Ω = 5 A.",

        "a": "Too high; check total resistance.",
        "b": "Too high; recheck the division.",
        "c": "Correct. Parallel of two 2Ω = 1Ω. Total R = 2Ω + 1Ω = 3Ω. I = 6/3 = 2 A.",

      "question": "Which circuit law states that the sum of all currents into and out of a node equals zero?",

        "d": "Norton's Current Law."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Lenz's Law deals with electromagnetic induction, not current at nodes.",
        "b": "Chebyshev's Law is unrelated to circuits.",
        "c": "Correct. Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) states that total current entering a node equals the total leaving.",
        "d": "Norton's Theorem deals with equivalent circuits, not node currents."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. An ideal current source provides constant current regardless of voltage.",
        "b": "Incorrect; controlled sources depend on other parameters.",
        "c": "This describes a voltage source, not current independence.",
