      "question": "Six volts is applied to a 2 ohm resistor in series with two 2 ohm resistors connected in parallel. The current through the first resistor is?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "3 A",
        "b": "2 A",
        "c": "1 A",
        "d": "0.5 A"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Too high; check total resistance.",
        "b": "Too high; recheck the division.",
        "c": "Correct. Parallel of two 2Ω = 1Ω. Total R = 2Ω + 1Ω = 3Ω. I = 6/3 = 2 A.",
        "d": "Too low; check Ohm's law."

      "question": "Which circuit law states that the sum of all currents into and out of a node equals zero?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Lenz's Current Law.",

        "c": "Kirchhoff's Current Law.",
        "d": "Norton's Current Law."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Lenz's Law deals with electromagnetic induction, not current at nodes.",
        "b": "Chebyshev's Law is unrelated to circuits.",
        "c": "Correct. Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) states that total current entering a node equals the total leaving.",
        "d": "Norton's Theorem deals with equivalent circuits, not node currents."

      "answers": {
        "a": "Ideal current source",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. An ideal current source provides constant current regardless of voltage.",
        "b": "Incorrect; controlled sources depend on other parameters.",
        "c": "This describes a voltage source, not current independence.",
