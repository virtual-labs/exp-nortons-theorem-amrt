        "a": "Not enough information is given.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. We have enough information: total resistance = 4Ω.",
        "b": "Too high; check Ohm’s law.",
        "c": "Correct. Total resistance = 4Ω; I = V/R = 5/4 = 1.25 A.",
        "d": "Too high; would require lower resistance."

      "question": "Five volts is applied to two 2 ohm resistors connected in parallel. The resulting current is?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "5 A",
        "b": "1 A",
        "c": "2.5 A",
        "d": "1.25 A"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Too high; implies a much lower total resistance.",
        "b": "Too low; calculate total parallel resistance.",
        "c": "Correct. Parallel resistance = 1Ω; I = 5V / 1Ω = 5 A.",
