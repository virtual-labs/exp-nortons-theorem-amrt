### About the Experiment 

Nortonâ€™s theorem for electrical networks states that any collection of voltage sources, current sources, and resistors with two terminals is electrically equivalent to an ideal current source, I, in parallel with a single resistor, R. For single-frequency AC circuits, the theorem can also be applied using impedances instead of resistances.
